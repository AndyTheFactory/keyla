#summary Developing tasks

==== Switching layouts using the tray icon menu ====

It's a very useful feature provided even by the Language Panel in Windows.

_Note._ Implementation isn't simple because when you click the tray icon, the active window looses focus. So a click at a hypothetical menu item will change the keyboard layout of keyla, not the one of the window you wished.

==== Indication of the current layout using keyboard LEDs ====

It's convenient when you can figure the current layout out with your side sight.

_Note._ AFAIK, there is an only way to control LEDs on an USB keyboard from the user mode in Windows NT4 and later. This way is to simulate that a key (!Caps !Lock, !Num Lock or !Scroll Lock) was pressed. The main question is how to enable the !Caps LED so that Windows won't go to the upper case mode... _IMHO_, if the task can not be solved for USB keyboards, it isn't worth to solve it for PS-2 keyboards only.
